Calling all restaurant owners and bookkeepers! 🍕🍔 Free resource alert!

I just created what might be the most comprehensive QBO guide for restaurants on the internet (according to Claude 😄):

📊 50+ step-by-step procedures
🏪 Complete restaurant Chart of Accounts  
💰 Daily cash reconciliation templates
📱 POS integration guides (Toast, Square, Clover)
🎯 KPI calculations with industry benchmarks

Here's what's inside:
✅ Daily Operations - Sales entry, tip handling, cash reconciliation
✅ Inventory - Food cost tracking, weekly counts, variance analysis  
✅ Payroll - Tip reporting, Form 8027, overtime calculations
✅ Monthly Closing - Week-by-week procedures
✅ Financial Analysis - Prime cost, labor %, table turnover

Real talk: I built this because I got tired of seeing restaurant owners struggle with their books. Good financials = better decisions = thriving restaurants.
